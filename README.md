- React Fiber, reconciliation, and the diff algorithm
- Virtual DOM concepts
- Bundlers and their functionality

- Props and state management using Redux Toolkit
- Client-side routing (CSR) and server-side routing (SSR)
- Working with live production API (Swiggy)

- Understanding Class-Based Components and component lifecycle methods
- Lazy loading techniques
- Optimization techniques
- Testing with React Testing Library and Jest framework
- And a lot more!
